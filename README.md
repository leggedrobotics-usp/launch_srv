## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**launch_srv** is a ROS package that provides:

- A service definition (Launch.srv) for calling launch files;
- A service server (launch_server.py) that implements this call;
- A launch file (foxglove.launch.py) that launches both the service server and [foxglove_bridge](https://github.com/foxglove/ros-foxglove-bridge).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This repo is a standard ROS2 package (ament_cmake).

### üõ† Prerequisites

- A ROS2 workspace (colcon)
    - See [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) to learn how to create your own workspace.

- Foxglove bridge
    - ```bash
      sudo apt install ros-<distro>-foxglove-bridge
      ```

### üíª Installing

As mentioned above, this repo is a standard ROS2 package. Thus, you simply have to clone it inside your workspace's **src** directory, making sure to use the **ros2** branch.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>/src
git clone -b ros2 https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/launch_srv.git
```

Then, use **colcon** to build.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Run the service server:

```bash
ros2 run launch_srv launch_server.py
```

Each service call will trigger the corresponding launch file on a separate process. Configure the inputs as follows:

- ```package_name``` (string): the name of the package that contains the desired launch file;
- ```launch_file``` (string): the launch file name (complete, with extension);
- ```parameters``` (string): if necessary, input the parameter list;
- ```terminate``` (boolean): set to ```false``` to start the launch process, or ```true``` to terminate it.

If you want to call the service using Foxglove Studio, use the included launch file instead:

```bash
ros2 launch launch_srv foxglove.launch.py
```
